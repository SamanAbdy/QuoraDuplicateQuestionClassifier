# QuoraDuplicateQuestionClassifier
This project classifies the duplicate question pairs for a popular site called Quora, it’s a platform to ask questions. 
This is a natural language processing (NLP) project where first I did basic text pre-processing then did feature engineering 
to drive basic features and then used advanced feature engineering to build some advanced features like token features, length 
based features and fuzzy features using “fuzzywuzzy”  and “nltk” libraries. Performed exploratory data analysis on the newly 
created features to understand their importance, then applied “Bag of Words(BOW)” for text vectorization using “CountVectorizer” 
class of “sklearn”, and finally did modelling, and selected random forest classifier, after applying different machine learning
algorithms and calculating the accuracy score and confusion matrix.
